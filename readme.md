# GraphQL + React Event Booking API

This project was built by following tutorial by Academind: [https://academind.com/tutorials/graphql-with-node-react-full-app/](https://academind.com/tutorials/graphql-with-node-react-full-app/).

I modified and or refactored some codes since the original codes used in the tutorial are out of date or deprecated.

Learn how to build a GraphQL API (with Node.js) and a React.js frontend from scratch.
